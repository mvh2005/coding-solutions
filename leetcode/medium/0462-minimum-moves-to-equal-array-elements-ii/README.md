# Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return  *the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal*.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `1`.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a  **32-bit**  integer.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,10,2,9]
Output: 16

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution

**Language:** Python  
**Runtime:** 5 ms (beats 43.62%)  
**Memory:** 12.9 MB (beats 96.71%)

```py
class Solution(object):
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        median = nums[len(nums)//2]
        return sum(abs(num - median) for num in nums) #Understanding the logic in this phase while sorting and finding the median of the array and finding the total sum of the differences of each number by meadiam term 
        
```
